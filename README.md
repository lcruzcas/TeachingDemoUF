# Class 9 - Incremental development

## Exercise
What are the incremental steps that you would use to achieve the following goal?

You are asked to design a software tool that 

(1) asks for input of the age (in years) of a user (e.g., 21)

(2) outputs whether the year the person was born is “odd” or “even”.  (e.g., 2001 is “odd”)

Hint: You are able to ask for one more input from the user if you need it.


## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains two possible solutions for this problem. 

**Solution 1** corresponds to the solution asking an extra input from the user.

**Solution 2** corresponds to a solution without asking an extra input from the user. 

## Exercise: 

Clone the current repository and create you own branch including the following two changes: 

(1) Create another functions that takes the inputs from the user. What type of function is this?

(2) (optional) Change the program so that is does not hardcode the year (2022) but rather takes the current year automatically.
