# Class 9 - Incremental development

## Exercises
What are the incremental steps that you would use to achieve the following goal?

You are asked to design a software tool that 
(1) asks for input of the age (in years) of a user (e.g., 21)
(2) outputs whether the year the person was born is “odd” or “even”.  (e.g., 2001 is “odd”)

Hint: You are able to ask for one more input from the user if you need it.


## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains two possible solutions for this problem. 

**Solution 1** corresponds to the solution asking an extra input from the user.

**Solution 2** corresponds to a solution without asking an extra input from the user.
